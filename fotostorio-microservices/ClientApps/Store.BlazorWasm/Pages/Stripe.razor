    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-8">Payment Processing with Stripe</h4>
    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-8">(Please Note: This is a demonstration site and no real card payments are being taken)</h4>
    <p class="text-base mb-4">This site uses a payment processor called <a href="https://stripe.com" target="_blank" class="text-blue-800 hover:underline hover:text-blue-800">Stripe</a> to process all of our orders.</p>
    <p class="text-base mb-4">
        During the ordering process, when a customer arrives on the checkout page, we allow Stripe to insert their own code into our page via a file securely stored on Stripe's servers.
        The input fields you see for your card number, expiry date and CVC are created directly by Stripe's code when the checkout page loads.
        Effectively, a small section of our site is controlled directly by Stripe themselves. We then 'listen' for any errors that Stripe detects, such as invalid or incomplete card numbers or expiry dates 
        and then display any problems on screen immediately, so that a customer can correct them before finally submitting their payment.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base font-semibold mb-4">
        We do this for a very specific reason: 
    </p>
    <p class="text-base mb-4">
        It means that a customer's card details never pass through our web server or database. Card details are collected by Stripe directly.
        They then process the payment by contacting the card issuing bank, completely independently of our site and then subsequently send us a notification of whether or not the funds could be obtained.
        This means that Stripe themselves are responsible for <a href="https://stripe.com/gb/guides/pci-compliance" target="_blank" class="text-blue-800 hover:underline hover:text-blue-800">maintaining PCI DSS compliance</a>.
        We do not receive details about the card used by the customer, only the result of Stripe's attempt to obtain the funds.
        The only details that we process and store in our database are the customer's name and email address, their delivery address, and the items they have ordered along with a unique identifier generated by Stripe that we can use to track the payment status.
